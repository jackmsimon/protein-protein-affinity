# Agentic PPI Affinity Enhancing Miniprotein Design

An agentic system for designing miniproteins that bind to protein dimer interfaces, increasing the likelihood that two proteins remain bound together. This pipeline analyzes protein complexes, identifies critical binding interfaces, and generates small stabilizing proteins that can enhance protein-protein interactions in dimeric systems.

The system leverages structural biology tools for interface analysis, LLM-driven design optimization, and automated RFdiffusion inference to create miniprotein binders targeting the junction regions where two proteins interact. By introducing additional binding partners at these interfaces, the system aims to strengthen existing protein-protein associations and reduce dissociation rates.

The workflow operates autonomously from PDB input through final miniprotein design, requiring no manual parameter tuning or structural intervention. This approach represents an exploratory method for computationally enhancing protein complex stability through designed binding partners.
